# just one

a web app for playing [just one](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one), a cooperative party word game.

why a web app, when the game works perfectly fine without one? because social distancing? the default wordlist is kinda eh? i want to be able to play the game over voice chat with friends? you figure it out.

## todo

- get a wordlist
- style better
- implement rooms
- deploy somewhere
- add more metadata i guess
